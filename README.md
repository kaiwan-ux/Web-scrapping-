This Python-based project focuses on web scraping to collect data from websites and presenting it through a Flask web application. Utilizing libraries like Beautiful Soup for parsing HTML and XML documents and Requests for handling HTTP requests, the project efficiently scrapes web content. Once the data is collected, it is displayed on a web interface created with Flask, allowing users to interact with the information dynamically. Users can filter the viewed data and refresh the content seamlessly without restarting the application. To set up the project, clone the repository, install necessary dependencies from the requirements.txt file, and run the scraper and Flask app scripts. The application will be accessible via a local server. This project combines Python's powerful scraping capabilities with Flask's simplicity to provide a user-friendly data interaction platform.
